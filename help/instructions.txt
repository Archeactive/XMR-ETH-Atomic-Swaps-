In case you want to run this software on your own, you will need a self-hosted monero node. After you download the monero
source code and synchronize your computer with the monero blockchain, enter the source code folder run the following commands:

$ monerod.exe
$ monero-wallet-cli.exe --use-english-language-names
$ monero-wallet-rpc.exe --daemon-address http://localhost:18081 --rpc-bind-port 38084 --wallet-file <WALLET NAME> --password <WALLET PASSWORD> --disable-rpc-login

NOTE: You first need a wallet file to initiate your own Monero RPC Server, which you must make via the monero-wallet-cli.exe program.
